## Hi, I'm glad you came here :)

### :grin: My name is Jan Jak√≥bczyk 
I am developing my knowledge in the area of frontend. My current goal is to familiarize myself with Next.js and TypeScript.
I'm going to apply for intership soon but I'm open to collaborating on opensource projects.

### :zzz: About me
I enjoy listening to heavy metal, having long conversations about life philosophy, astrophysics and coding. I also visit the gym and swimming pool regularly.

#### something more:
* heartfelt person with sense of humor :sparkling_heart:
* able to manage the stress and focus on the goal :wink:
* like everyone even those who don't like me (but there are no such :) :clown_face:
