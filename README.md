## Hi, I'm glad you came here :)

### :grin: My name is Jan Jak√≥bczyk 
I am developing my knowledge in the area of frontend. My current main goal is to familiarize myself with Next.js.
I'm going to apply for intership soon but I'm open to collaborating on opensource projects.

### :zzz: About me
I enjoy listening to heavy metal, astrophysics, coding and having long conversations about life philosophy. I also visit the gym and swimming pool regularly.

#### something more:
* heartfelt person with sense of humor :sparkling_heart:
* able to manage the stress and focus on the goal :wink:
* willingness to learn and self-development :fire:
* personal culture and respect for everyone :thumbsup:
